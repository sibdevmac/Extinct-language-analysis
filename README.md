# 🌍 Endangered Languages Analysis  
### World Language Day – 21st February

Every year on **21st February**, we celebrate *World Language Day*, honoring our mother tongue and linguistic diversity.  

But have we paused to think about the languages that are slowly disappearing from society?

As data analysts, it becomes our responsibility to analyze trends, identify risks, and understand which languages are losing ground globally. This project explores endangered and extinct languages using data-driven analysis.

# 🔎 Key Insights from the Analysis

---

## 1️⃣ Languages by Endangerment Level

**Graph:** *Languages by Endangerment Level*

- Very few languages have already become extinct.
- Most languages fall under:
  - *Definitely Endangered*
  - *Vulnerable*
  - Other early-risk categories.
- This provides some hope for conservation efforts.
- Linguists and researchers still have opportunities to intervene before languages disappear completely.

## 2️⃣ Speaker Decline Across Endangerment Stages

**Graph:** *Speaker Decline Across Endangerment Stages*

- The highest decline in speakers is observed in the **Vulnerable** stage.
- Surprisingly, decline is rare in the **Extinct** stage (as speakers are already lost).
- This suggests that conservation efforts may exist, but:
  - It remains unclear whether they are fully effective.
  - Early intervention is critical.

## 3️⃣ Projected Global Language Decline

**Graph:** *Projected Global Language Decline*

Languages such as:

- ǁXegwi (South Africa)  
- Kede (Angola)  
- Kayeli (Indonesia)  

are facing severe extinction risks if conservation efforts are not strengthened.

Based on current language dynamics:

- There is a high probability that many vulnerable languages may disappear by **2100**.
- Immediate documentation and revitalization efforts are essential.

## 4️⃣ Language Survival Probability Curve

**Graph:** *Language Survival Probability Curve*

- The initial decline is extremely sharp.
- Once a language becomes **"Definitely Endangered"** (children stop learning it), survival probability drops drastically.
- After intergenerational transmission breaks:
  - Only elderly speakers remain.
  - Language decline accelerates rapidly.
- Without youth adoption, long-term survival becomes nearly impossible.

---

## 5️⃣ Global Distribution of Endangered Languages

**Graph:** *Global Distribution of Endangered Languages (Map)*

- Endangered languages are distributed worldwide.
- A faster decline is observed in several regions, especially **India**.
- In India:
  - Many endangered languages are concentrated in tribal belts.
  - North-East regions show higher linguistic vulnerability.
- Although conservation attempts exist, India remains in a **late-stage linguistic risk zone** for many tribal languages.

---

# 📌 Conclusion

This analysis highlights that:

- Language extinction is not just a cultural issue — it is a measurable, data-driven global concern.
- Early intervention significantly improves survival probability.
- Tribal and indigenous languages are at the highest risk.
- Data analytics can play a crucial role in identifying and prioritizing conservation efforts.

On World Language Day, celebrating linguistic diversity should also mean protecting languages that are struggling to survive.
